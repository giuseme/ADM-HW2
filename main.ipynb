    "We dealt with a huge amount of data from the files `2019-Oct.csv` and `2019-Nov.csv`. These files have a total size equal to 13,4GB. For all the questions, we reduced the amount of RAM required by loading only the needed columns and, since some columns data allows it, we forced some data casting to data types smaller in size. Specifically, for example, we loaded the `user_id` values as `numpy.int32` instead of default `numpy.int64`, since we observed that `user_id` values are of 10<sup>8</sup> order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we tried to handle these data applying two different strategies. The first one was execute the fucntions in a AWS EC2 instance configured with the proper quantity of RAM. According to the second one, we implemented some functions chunking the dataset, computing by chunk and then combining the results. We are aware that this implementation adds a lot of overhead, but this way we managed to run these functions on a laptop with only 8GB of RAM. These functions are included in the file `./scripts/our_functions_low_memory` that we chose to use in this notebook. All the questions marked with a **\\*** were solved with such functions. For these questions, we also provide a file with a more computationally efficent implementation (see `./scripts/our_functions.py`)."
